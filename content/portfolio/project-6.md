      Julz Insight is the first subsidiary of JULZ, designed to be Africa’s
      Digital Sovereignty Engine. It provides Managed Open Source Business
      Infrastructure—enterprise-grade systems that empower organizations to
      operate independently of foreign-controlled platforms. This ensures
      African businesses, governments, and institutions can build, scale, and
      secure their digital operations without sacrificing autonomy.

    content: >-
      Africa’s digital landscape is heavily reliant on imported, proprietary
      technologies. This dependency creates vulnerabilities: data sovereignty
      risks where sensitive information is stored offshore, high licensing costs
      that stifle innovation, and limited adaptability since proprietary systems
      often fail to reflect local needs and realities.
